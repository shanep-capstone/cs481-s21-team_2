## User Story

As a user of the warehouse management program/worker in a warehouse, I want to be able to access easily to 
the different functionality of the program through a simple and clear interface
 so I am able to do my work efficiently 

## Tasks

1. Display a menu on the console (STOUT) showing all the functionalities
2. Take input from the user throught (STDIN) to access to a specific function
3. After the input is entered by the user, display a specific menu for each function and guidelines on how to use it, 
4. Create a return function to be able to return to the main menu from each functionality
5. Ensure the user has clear guidelines on how to use the main menu, each function and what kind of input are expected or guidelines when the user is entering a wrong input

### Time estimation method
Difficulty of the task :
Minor:1 to 3 hours of work
Medium:3 to 5 hours of work
Major:More than 5 hours of work

Estimation will be made by the team
Task 1: Medium 
Task 2: Minor
Task 3: Medium  
Task 4: Minor
Task 5: Major 

The team used planning poker to estimate that each of my tasks is roughly 13 hours minimum of work.
This time is not including meeting, conception, brainstrom and integration time
We are planning 3 hours of meeting per week for the conception/reflexion about the menu and 2 more hours per week inthe last week for the integration and test.

## Definition of Done

- Task 1 DOD - I will know that I am done when I can see the menu on the console once I start the program
- Task 2 DOD - I will know that I am done when I can access to each function from a specific input from the STDIN
- Task 3 DOD - I will know that I am done when I can access to a specific menu for each function with the right input or  guidelines are dipslayed if I enter a wrong input
- Task 4 DOD - I will know that I am done when from anywhere in the menu I can go back to the main menu
- Task 5 DOD - I will know that I am done when the users can access easily to each function and know what to do in any situation while using the program (user acceptance test)
