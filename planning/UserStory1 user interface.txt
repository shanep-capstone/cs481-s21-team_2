## User Story

As a user of the warehouse management program/worker in a warehouse, I want to be able to access easily to 
the different functionality of the program through a simple and clear interface
 so I am able to do my work efficiently 

## Tasks

1. Display a menu on the console (STOUT) showing all the functionalities
2. Take input from the user throught (STIN) to access to a specific function
3. After the input is entered by the user, display a specific menu for each function and guidelines on how to use it, 
4. Create a return function to be able to return to the main menu from each functionality
5. Ensure the user has clear guidelines on how to use the main menu, each function and what kind of input are expected or guidelines when the user is entering a wrong input

### Time estimation method
Difficulty of the task :
Minor:1 to 3 hours of work

Major:More than 5 hours of work

Estimation will be made by the team
Task 1: Medium 
Task 2: Minor
Task 3: Medium
