# Journal 3

### Attendance: Nicolas Dupuis, Anna Han, Troy Livingston
### Date: February 4, 5, 7, 2021

- Our team need to select framework and programming language for the tech lab: We couldn't choose which program language will use for our project. Our professor recommended C# and .NEt for the frame. We discussed to choose Java and framework Spring when we decided this project. We will do both language until we select the language.
 
- Our development machine need to be setup for both language, so it will take double time. We installed Visual Studio for C# and Intellij Community for Java.
 
- For the framework, We choose Spring MVC and Boot for java and Nicolas summarized for readme. I summarized Net framework and Troy edited overall.
