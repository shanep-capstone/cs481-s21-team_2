### Attendance: Nicolas Dupuis, Anna Han, Troy Livingston
### Date: March 4,7  2021

  - Our team tried to make at least 5 tasks for each user story except the test. We didnâ€™t include the test in the definition of done.

  - Through the definition of done we could plan our program with more detail and set up the schedule for our work.

  - Nicolas suggested the plan to help our team build our tasks.

  - We schetched the main menu page and its sub-pages. Plan to work with database for those sub-pages.



### **My task for this week:**

- [x] Code the main menu page on the console

- [x] Work on the design of each functionality page

- [x] Look for the database in C#


 ### **Check our "Tasks"**

 - [x] Planning documents follow the provided template located in the planning folder

    - All required sections are present


 - [x] Planning documents all have a detailed user story

    - User story is in role-goal-benefit form
    - User story has sufficient detail to derive 5 tasks


 - [x] 5 or more tasks are defined (one task per week is a good goal)

 - [x] Planning documents have a detailed write up about the time estimation method used

 - [x] The definition of done (DOD) gives clear criteria for determining when the student has finished each of their tasks and can be demonstrated programmatically.
