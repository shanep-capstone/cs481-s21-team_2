# Meeting 0

### Attendance: Nicolas Dupuis, Anna Han, Troy Livingston
### Date: January 21,2021

- Our team started to work for team contract our first zoom meeting to know our team. We shared our opinion about how we can have a great outcome through the capston class. Based on our experience from our former group works, all of team members wanted to try to support each other. This team contract was not for making hard standard but for making good relationship and outcome.

- Our team looked at the several Licences that we might be safely use for project. Since we didn't choose our project, we discussed about GNU and MIT licences. Later as we decide our project, the team will update by considering our purpose.


- Our team skimmed the sponsored projects. Those projects seem to need quite knowledge about other subject fields. I thought we needed to review those projects individually and share our opinion in the next meeting. 

- For the project idea, we couldn't come up with many ideas but shared several ideas. Our team decided to have a short meeting later after thinking about more ideas.

- Our team had another zoom meeting before class    started and shared our project ideas. This time we taked about the steps for planning also.
