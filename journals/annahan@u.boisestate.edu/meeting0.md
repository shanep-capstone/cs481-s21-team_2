# Meeting 0

### Attendance: Nicolas Dupuis, Anna Han, Troy Livingston
### Date: January 21,2021

- Our team started to work for team contract our first zoom meeting to know our team. We shared our opinion about how we can have a great outcome through the capston class. Based on our experience from our former group works, all of team members wanted to try to support each other. This team contract was not for making hard standard but for making good relationship and outcome.

- Our team looked at the several Licences that we might be safely use for project. Since we didn't choose our project, we discussed about GNU and MIT licences. Later as we decide our project, the team will update by considering our purpose.
