### Date: January 28,2021

After discussing about our team projece, our team came up with 4 ideas.

- Supply chain management app: multiple warehouses, stock count, receiving, exporting, etc.. We could start with a basic app with/ ref number , number of item, description of the item, item location in the warehouse … then we could entry and remove report in the stock on the week, month, etc, generate automatic alert if an item is closed to is minimum level of storage (security storage) and when to order according to the delivery time for this item...

- Game using java gui: a strategic board game or more dynamic game such as a space invader.
Develop an addon or plugin for games like Minesweeper game addon or plugin for sound

- Bank web app: an app to analyse your financial behavior , generating spending reports , giving information on what is the average spending per month / average income for an american family , a student, a couple … , give information about the taxes/ federal, for each states, and compare with your own accounts 

- Chrome app or extension: get grocery list from receipt and give notice after 3 days for checking that was used or still in the refrigerator.
