### Attendance: Nicolas Dupuis, Anna Han, Troy Livingston
### Date: February 25, 28, March 2,  2021

        1. choose Workflows made for .NET Core Desktop and commit yml file to main -> Actions
        - NET 5.0 is the next major release of .NET Core following 3.1. We named this new release .NET 5.0 instead of .NET Core 4.0
 
        2. Our tean found out our desktop app wasn't working properly in Action. We started research about this situation and found out we have to build out a project on .NET 5. From the visual studio code, our project was fine to work but not with Action.
 
        3. According to Microsoft documents, our team followed each step to set up the direction for the subdirectory. We manually set the environment for the directory but we couldn't succeed in Action. But manual tests and builds with dotnet in the command line are still successful. So we can keep our project.
 
        4. Our team scheduled office hours with Dr. Panter on March 2. Our team and Dr. Panter were going through and trying to find out how it can be worked through Microsoft documents. The current documents couldn't solve our problem. It might be the version is very new also Action is new, so both programs still need to be updated. Dr. Panter suggests that we can move on to the next work since our team spends much of time on this one. Our team decided to move on to the next step.
