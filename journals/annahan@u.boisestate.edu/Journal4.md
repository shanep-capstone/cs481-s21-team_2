- For build or run our code for java, we tried to make a makefile. We also tried to set up framework Spring to eclipse. There was some difference between the old version and new version of eclipse. For C#, it's built already and just need to use it. Before making build and clean files, we had to decide which language we should choose for our program. We chose C#. Our team started to more closely about C# from now on.

- Microsoft document provide dotnet command information.  dotnet is the generic driver for .NET CLI. It provides commands for working with .NET projects and run .NET applications.

- asp.net core is cross flatform(Win, Mac, Linux). 

- We chose Visual Studio 2019 Community for environment setting.
     - a new project: C#, All platform, Desktop, choose Windows Form App. 
     - through dotnet new can make a basic template.
