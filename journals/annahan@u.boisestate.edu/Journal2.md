After discussing about our team project, our team came up with 4 ideas.

- Supply chain management app: multiple warehouses, stock count, receiving, exporting, etc.. We could start with a basic app with/ ref number , number of item, description of the item, item location in the warehouse … then we could entry and remove report in the stock on the week, month, etc, generate automatic alert if an item is closed to is minimum level of storage (security storage) and when to order according to the delivery time for this item...

- Game using java gui: a strategic board game or more dynamic game such as a space invader.
Develop an addon or plugin for games like Minesweeper game addon or plugin for sound

- Bank web app: an app to analyse your financial behavior , generating spending reports , giving information on what is the average spending per month / average income for an american family , a student, a couple … , give information about the taxes/ federal, for each states, and compare with your own accounts 

- Chrome app or extension: get grocery list from receipt and give notice after 3 days for checking that was used or still in the refrigerator.

Our team select **Warehouse management**

- We started to write an epic briefly. I felt I didn't have enough information and knowledge about Warehouse management compared to other team members. So we planned to have another meeting on Sunday and research about wharehouse management.

-  We shared our ideas about our goal for this project. Most of our epic was set. We decided to have one more meeting to add more ideas about epic before next class. So we gathered on Tuesday, added ideas and made the conclusion of our epic.
