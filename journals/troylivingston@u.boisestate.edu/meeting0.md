# Meeting 0

### Attendance: Nicolas Dupuis, Anna Han, Troy Livingston
### Date: January 21,2021

This week was mainly coming up with project ideas. We had finished the set up lab prior to this meeting. The team seems like we meld pretty well and we all get along. Most of the meeting we were tossing up ideas and seeing how we might go about it or what features could be implemented. A large topic we talked about was being able to have a project that is easy to have working at a base level, but has the capacity to add a lot of features to it so that we have something ready each week but still have more to do. We had though about making a simple game like a frogger clone or a tetris clone, but I think we are leaning towards our other two ideas. Those ideas would be an online banking app and a supply chain/inventory management java app. the bank app and the inventory app would be simple enough to start and have something basic working, but like I had metioned earlier they have a lot of potential of features that can be added to it allowing us to have a working app that we constantly expand.

### **My task for this week:**

- Help think of project ideas and what we might do with these ideas and come to a final project decision
