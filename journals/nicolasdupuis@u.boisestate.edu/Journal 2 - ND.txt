Meeting 1
Attendance: Nicolas Dupuis, Anna Han, Troy Livingston
Date: January 28,2021
This week, the team focused on the project brainstorm, We reviewed the sponsored projects but we were not intered by any of them.
We came up with different ideas with the team :
Create a video game

a warehouse / supply chain management program

a bank web app to help the user to budget their expense, analyse their financial beahivior, help them saving money...
 
A grocery list app to help manage the food and menu

After discussing more with the team, we selected 2 project the bank app and the warehouse. The video game seems really vague and we did not have clear guidelines on where to start , for the grocery list , we were not really attracted by this project the final goal of the app was unsure

After debating the pros and cons of both projects selected , we finally choose the warehouse management project as we could first developp it as an in house program then develop a web interface. For the bank app project , we were also worried about the data protection  as personal finance data are really sensitive

We described the different parts and feature of the warehouse project and check if it will match the projects requirements
