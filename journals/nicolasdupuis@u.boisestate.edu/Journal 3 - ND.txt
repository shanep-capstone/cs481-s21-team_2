Meeting 3
Attendance: Nicolas Dupuis, Anna Han, Troy Livingston
Date: Feb 03, 2021
This week, the team focused on the tech lab , we choose the langueges and framework we will use for the project
Following the teacher recommandation we decided to select for the programming language C# and .NET for the framework. But as none of us are familiar with this programming language we decided to select 
also java as a safety net and for the framework Spring. We will do all the next assignements in both language which allow us to keep our options open for both language and if during th next assignments
or during the firsts days of development we will select the most appropriate language.

We investigated about C# and it seems closed to Java but also really relevant to use for our project.
