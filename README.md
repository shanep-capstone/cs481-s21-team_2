## Project : Warehouse management

### Overview


Storage management is part of a lot of businesses but also one of the most complicated tasks to execute, some businesses are doing it manually with pieces of paper or excel file , others businesses bought sometimes expensive software. We would like to create a program that could handle most of the warehouse management functions to help these businesses. 
 
Warehouse management is control of the day-to-day operations of a warehouse such as the shipping, receiving and put-away and picking of goods. The program  should maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.
