Project : Warehouse management

Overview

Storage management is part of a lot of businesses but also one of the most complicated tasks to execute, some businesses are doing it manually with pieces of paper or excel file , others businesses bought sometimes expensive software. We would like to create a program that could handle most of the warehouse management functions to help these businesses. 
 
Our first goal for the project will be to have a warehouse management software which will be stored on on a personal computer or a server, from a main menu you will have access to several basic functions :
1: File entry: with a file containing relevant information (items , reference, quantity, locations...) you will enter what is stored in the warehouse.	
2:Shipping / receiving command: to enter any new entry or shipping in the warehouse 
3 Report: report could created by for specific item(s) and/or for a specific time period to let the user know the shipping and receiving entries , stock left
4: file update : this command will generate/ update a file on the warehouse storage (update file you entered in command 1 after you used command 2)
 
Our second goal will be to develop a web application where you could use your warehouse to rent storage space and invoice your customer, or also includes features to have a more complete supply chain management program , these features will help to manage the delivery time, the orders , stock management to store most valuable items using less space or check the turnover of specific items (food). 
 
Invoicing : adding a feature where you could enter a price per items to know the value of what is stored, the cost of storage per item/ sq foot ( to manage more efficiently your storage space or/and  send invoice to your customer renting part of your warehouse)
Delivery: adding a feature to know the delivery time per items and the minimum stock level they need, it will generate an alert or pit on the report on command 4 what items need to be reorder.
Enter what items and how much items you used on a time period ( weekly, monthly) the a report will tell when you will be below you security stock level and when to reorder according to the delivery time
