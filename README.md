## Project Epic

### Project : Warehouse management

### Overview


Storage management is part of a lot of businesses but also one of the most complicated tasks to execute, some businesses are doing it manually with pieces of paper or excel file, others businesses bought sometimes expensive software. We would like to create a program that could handle most of the warehouse management functions to help these businesses. 
 
Warehouse management is control of the day-to-day operations of a warehouse such as the *shipping, receiving and put-away and picking of goods*. The program  should maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.

 
**Our first goal** for the project will be to have a warehouse management software which will be stored on on a personal computer or a server, from a main menu you will have access to several basic functions:

1. **File entry**: with a file containing relevant information (items , reference, quantity, locations...) you will enter what is stored in the warehouse.	

    _Task:  Implement inventory tracking function_

2. **Shipping / receiving command**: to enter any new entry or shipping in the warehouse 

3. **Report**: report could created by for specific item(s) and/or for a specific time period to let the user know the shipping and receiving entries , stock left

    _Task: Implement Total Transaction Management functionality_

4. **file update** : this command will generate/ update a file on the warehouse storage (update file you entered in command 1 after you used command 2)

    _Task: Improve warehouse performance_

5. **Shipping support**: to manage the shipping shipment notifications or rearrangement notification
 
**Our second goal** will be to develop a web application where you could use your warehouse to rent storage space and invoice your customer, or also includes features to have a more complete supply chain management program , these features will help to manage the delivery time, the orders , stock management to store most valuable items using less space or check the turnover of specific items (like food):
 
1. **Invoicing** : adding a feature where you could enter a price per items to know the value of what is stored, the cost of storage per item/ sq foot ( to manage more efficiently your storage space or/and  send invoice to your customer renting part of your warehouse)

2. **Delivery**: adding a feature to know the delivery time per items and the minimum stock level they need, it will generate an alert or pit on the report on command 4 what items need to be reorder.

3. **Enter** what items and how much items you used on a time period ( weekly, monthly) the a report will tell when you will be below you security stock level and when to reorder according to the delivery time

    _Task: Implement reporting features_
 
 4. **Improve visibility**: To make planning and forecasting easier for managers, visibility allows users to increase the accuracy of handling their products.

5. **Build the Login page** with authentication for web
